# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Python Ransomware Proof-of-Concept project. We appreciate your effort and to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved, we've outlined a set of guidelines.

Please take a moment to read through the following guidelines:

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on this project happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Branch Policy

* `main` is the default branch and is used for production.

## Pull Requests

* Work on feature branches and submit a pull request when ready. 
* Ensure your PR adheres to our coding and style guidelines.
* Please ensure to provide a summary of the changes in the pull request description.
* Write detailed commit messages, following the commit message guidelines below.

## Commit Message Guidelines

* The commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
* If your patch fixes an open issue, you can add a reference to it at the end of the log. Use the `Fixes:` prefix and the full issue URL. For other references use `Refs:`

## Reporting a bug

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue. Make sure that you provide a detailed description of the bug, including steps to reproduce and, if possible, screenshots.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public API, or make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue. This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it.

## License

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (please see the [License file](LICENSE) for more details).

Thanks again for your contribution, we appreciate your work and are looking forward to building a great tool together!
